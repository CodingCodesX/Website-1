      <p>In order to bring awareness to the detrimental effect of space debris, we are introducing a database that
        provides information on the origin of the debris. This would allow individuals to have access to information
        that could lead to efforts — protests, demonstrations, etc. — in relation to publicity. Public awareness and
        international education is necessary in order to create noteworthy changes and garner greater support
        towards
        the situation. By addressing the potential calamitous impacts that could result from space debris alongside
        providing the origin of the object involved, it would build incentives, encourage responsibility, and create
        a
        sense of accountability for the management of space junk. Our database would shine a light onto the
        importance
        of international cooperation and the necessary rework required for proper space regulation. Lastly, because
        the human mind wouldn't be able to comprehend the scale in which space debris is prominent, we plan on
        visualizing the problem at hand. It would bring further attention to sustainable practices for future human
        civilization developments.</p>

      <h1>How To Use The Database</h1>
      <p>Our database sorts out information from AstriaGraph and categorizes each piece of debris and rocket bodies
        based upon their country of origin. In order to use this database, an individual must determine a location
        (country) they are interested in and simply enter it into the search bar to acquire specific information on a
        unique space debris. Each piece of debris will be assigned a distinctive numeric code which could then be used
        to enter into AstriaGraph where further information would be provided. This type of information includes
        components such as its name, origin date, inclination, mean motion, orbital speed, and orbital period. Factors
        such as the names of the debris or rocket bodies would allow the user to be able to identify their course
        through their orbit. Subsequently, individuals can determine the danger the debris poses and alert the
        authoritative figures in order to sort out solutions to fix the matter.
