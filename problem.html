      Space debris, otherwise known as space junk, are human-derived harmful waste that orbits the Earth. These waste are categorized into numerous groups depending on their origins and size which includes macro, micro, and millimeter-sized debris. To provide a deeper insight, macro debris are large objects such as discarded satellites and rocket parts; micro debris are small fragments from collisions or larger objects; and millimeter-sized debris are particle dust that are normally in the range of one centimeter to one millimeter in size. According to NASA, roughly thirty-thousand bits of orbital debris are tracked by the Department of Defenseâ€™s global Space Surveillance Network sensors with the sole purpose of protecting space flights for important missions. These debris are detrimental and a threat to human safety, as relatively small object debris, if traveling at sufficiently high speeds, are still able to cause substantial impact damage with space infrastructure. As such, considering there are approximately one-hundred million pieces of debris sized one millimeter and larger, space debris is a massive safety concern for our infrastructure and astronauts.

There are innumerable sources of space debris. Fragmentation and erosion of extraterrestrial objects, launches of orbital vessels into space, collisions between space technology, and satellite breakups all serve to leave fragments of debris around Earth. With the exception of debris deorbiting and burning up in the atmosphere, space debris remains free to encircle the earth, posing a risk to necessary infrastructure. The impacts of this event could be framed in the realm of hazards for astronauts, as well as dangers to space shuttles and satellites. On a larger perspective, space debris halts space exploration and development on a tremendous scale. Furthermore, space junk is most commonly derived from countries such as Russia, China, and the United States, and can be preventable with the correct practices. Debris could be monitored from radars and telescopes, SSN, and organizations whose main goal is to prevent space collisions from occurring.
